# DASC41103Project3
 - In order to run the project, download the repo to your computer
 - Unzip folder into whichever directory you prefer
 - _(this is very important)_ Unzip the folder `Project3Data` directly into the same directory (when clicked on from repo's folder, it should open directly to the `train`, `test`, and `validate` folder
 - Open the file `DASC41103 Project3.ipynb` into VSCode
    - Note, Google Collab does NOT work for this notebook
 - Press "Run All"
    
- _note: the hyperparameter code chunk took 73 minutes to run on my laptop_
